* vagrantfile that can launch and configure various distros*



Note: This repo was abandoned and unused for a couple of years. I recently
needed some ansible playbooks for a different project for test data,
which this repo happened to work for. This required moving playbook
locations, which may have broken the vagrantfile. I don't really care
about that at this point, so those will
likely remain broken for the foreseeable future.
